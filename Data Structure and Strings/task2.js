/*Coding Challenge #2
Let's continue with our football betting app! Keep using the 'game' variable from before.
Your tasks:
1. Loopoverthegame.scoredarrayandprinteachplayernametotheconsole, along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
2. Usealooptocalculatetheaverageoddandlogittotheconsole(Wealready studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
3. Printthe3oddstotheconsole,butinaniceformattedway,exactlylikethis:
Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33 Odd of draw: 3.25
Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them (except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the same property names ðŸ˜‰
4. Bonus:Createanobjectcalled'scorers'whichcontainsthenamesofthe players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this game, it will look like this:
     {
       Gnarby: 1,
       Hummels: 1,
       Lewandowski: 2
}*/

  const odds = Object.values(game.odds);
